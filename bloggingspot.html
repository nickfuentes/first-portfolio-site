				<h1>HOW BAD DO YOU WANT IT</h1>
				<p>Published by Nickolas Fuentes</p>
				<p>April 18, 2017</p>
				<p>Tonight I was going to go to bed after learning JavaScript from FreeCodeCamp. I was learning in the Algorithm section and was struggling on some of the projects. I was introduced to some new and old for loops, and some methods. I was looking up so much of the problems I had to look it all up and hated that I would run into the answer. As I would complete the project I would think to myself, how would I have ever thought of that and man I do not understand how this works. I would sit and stare at the problem and answer and be like man am I not up to the skill level for this section? I got down on myself and said Nick what are you doing trying to become a web developer you know you are not the smartest kid and all these algorithms how are you going to remember and learn them all. There is so much to learn Nick you know this is going to take forever to remember you wont get a job till a year or more from now at this rate! So I stopped and went to bed just thinking about all this. </p>
				<p>As I laid in bed I told myself why did your start this what are your motives of pursuing this career path. First I did not like the career I got my degree in, the job growth for programming is astounding, but most of all I enjoyed creating something on the web that people can see all across the world. I produced a website to where people can see me and notice me strictly with just HTML and CSS from scratch with the basics. I did that with research and hard work and I never felt more accomplished in my life. I want a job I can support my future family, I want a job I can continue to challenge myself and grow and I want a job I can wake up to and be happy to go to. </p>
				<p>So I got up out of bed at 3:18 am in the morning and decided to write this. Do not let the negativity and struggle discourage you from pursuing what you want. Be positive and keep your eyes on what you are focused on. I like to say you have to look at the big picture but take it piece by piece and learn to be patient.</p>
				<p>I am not going to be another developer to give up on this and settle for an everyday job. This career has so much power and reward why give up? I am going to keep pushing till I get this down and become comfortable with it. If you made it down this far please do not give up on your dreams no matter what it is pursue with all your heart and live it.</p>

				<h1>FIRST THING TO LEARN</h1>
				<p>Published by Nickolas Fuentes</p>
				<p>April 18, 2017</p>
				<p>So you are beginner and interested in learning web development. The first thing you are going to need to learn is HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). HTML is the foundation of becoming a web developer and is what you see when viewing a website. </p>
				<p>The next thing I would learn is CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). You can think of CSS as make-up for HTML, which makes it look more pretty. CSS can make regular paragraphs more enjoyable to read with Google Fonts. You can add a color theme to your website down to the shade of your choosing with using RGB and HEX colors. If you want to center or move an image to the left or right that is also done in CSS. CSS is a big design aspect it and can make your website a totally new site if done right.</p>
				<p>The sources I would recommend for this is HTML and CSS by John Ducket, CodeCademy and FreeCodeCamp. Hope you all have a fun time learning HTML and CSS till next time!

				<h1>WHY IM BLOGGING</h1>
				<p>Published by Nickolas Fuentes</p>
				<p>April 7, 2017</p>
				<p>So lets dive in to why I am starting this blog. I have never been a blogger and would not consider myself a person that would. But as I started to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript I was getting over whelmed with the amount of resources there is out there. There were times when I learned something but then looked it up and someone did it another way. How do people know what is the correct way to write a line of code?</p>
				<p>There were times when I had to step away with frustration of wanting to find the right way to do something. But when I was stepping away from my text editor I would look for motivation from other programmers on sources like Instagram, YouTube and Blogs. They all gave same advice to new programmers like myself to not give up and to keep learning. They would say the beginning is the hardest part and after that you will get the hang of it. So I took this advice and pushed through source after source until I finally got the basics of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap the way I wanted it to work and look and the correct way. I learned how to put certain things in a div, how to style an HTML file with CSS and use the class container properly. It was just trial and error and actually inputting it into a text editor and playing around with it. I by no means am a pro at HTML, CSS and Bootstrap but I am not scared of it because I know it is a matter of time that I will understand it correctly.</p>
				<p>All those trial and errors made me realize there are many other beginner programmers out there going through the same thing. Most of us only see the other side of making it and becoming a programmer and seeing the success part. I hope I can capture the side of programming that is tough. I want to be able to show others a point of view from the beginning to hopefully the end of what it takes to learn a programming language.  </p>

				<h1>WHO IS NICKOLAS FUENTES</h1>
				<p>Published by Nickolas Fuentes</p>
				<p>April 5, 2017</p>
				<p>I hope this article lets you understand a little about me. The name is Nickolas Fuentes but I go by Nick. I just moved back to my hometown of Houston, Texas after obtaining a degree in Public Relations and Mass Communications. I would love to stay in the city of Houston but if I ever got a job opportunity to move up north where seasons actually exist it will be a hard decision.</p>
				<p>I love playing basketball on my free time and been playing it for about five years now. Basketball is a very big part of my life as it is a way to stay active and relieve any stress. I am huge sports fan of the Astros, Texans, Rockets and Dynamo if they are on T.V. I will watch and cheer till I loose my voice. I am a believer in God and call myself a Christian and am blessed that he has guided me this far and given me the support that I have surrounding me. I have never been much of an adventurous person but spending my years in college where my surroundings were hiking trails, nature and lakes it became another hobby for me to take on. I hope as the years go by I visit more national parks and hiking trails to see and explore.</p>
				<p>One of the biggest lessons in life that I am focusing on is not spending money on things but on memories. I was the type of person who loved getting the latest and greatest technology, clothes and whatever else I could think of but being in college I experienced so many great memories that are priceless. I hope as time goes by I can implement this thinking more into my life.</p>
				<p>Well that is pretty much me hope I was not to all over the place.  I know by now your wondering but wait Nick why have you not said anything about how you got started writing code yet? Well that is a topic for the next blog. Thank you to all who took the time to read this article.</p>
